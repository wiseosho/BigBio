ACM Bulletin ACM Learning Webinars May 19, 2016 Register for June 17 Talk with Adrian Cockroft: "The Evolution of Microservices" Register for the next free ACM Learning Webinar, "The Evolution of Microservices," presented on Friday, June 17 at 12 pm ET by Adrian Cockroft, Technology Fellow at Battery Ventures. (If you'd like to attend but can't make it to the virtual event, register now to receive a recording of the webinar when it becomes available.) Note: You can stream this and all ACM Learning Webinars on your mobile device, including smartphones and tablets. Where did microservice architectures come from and where are they going? Architecture patterns are optimizations based on assumptions about what is expensive or difficult vs. what is cheap or easy. As technology evolves things that were formerly hard to do become trivial, and a disconnect arises that causes old architectural and organizational patterns to become obsolete, and new ones to appear. Over the last few years cloud and containerization have driven a move to microservice architectures, serverless deployments and integrated DevOps based organizations. Products, the organizations that build them, and the architectures that implement them all need to be able to evolve as they adapt to changes on shorter and shorter timescales. This talk will describe how to simulate and visualize large scale microservices deployments in a few seconds. Duration: 60 minutes (including audience Q&A) Presenter:
Adrian Cockroft, Technology Fellow, Battery Ventures
